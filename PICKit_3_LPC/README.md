# PICKit 3 Low Pin Count Demo Board (8-bits)

The PICkit 3 Low Pin Count Demo Board (**DM164130-9**) is an update to the PICkit™ 2 Demo Board. Modifications to the previous LPC board (**DM164120-1**) were made so that the full functionality of the code can be debugged without the need of a debug header. The software has also been rewritten to accommodate new technologies.
