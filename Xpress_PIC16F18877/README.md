# Board (8-bits)

The MPLAB Xpress Evaluation Board (**DM164142**) has the PIC16F18877 MCU as the centerpiece of the MPLAB Xpress board. The product family features a 10-bit ADC with Computation (ADC2) for automated signal analysis, helping reduce system complexity. The MCUs include Core Independent Peripherals, communication, CRC/SCAN, Hardware Limit Timer (HLT) and Windowed WDT (WWDT) to support customers looking to add safety and monitoring to their system. Additionally, these products also feature power conserving functionality, including Idle/Doze operating modes, Peripheral Module Disable (PMD) and eXtreme Low-Power (XLP) technology for a wide range of applications.
